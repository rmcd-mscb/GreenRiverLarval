Initial calibration notes.

First calibration will be run on the peak flow during field sampling period.  The peak at the Jensen gage was 4000 cfs at 3/28/2018 1:30.  Assuming the discharge is constant through the reach we pick the peak stage at each of the downloaded hobo's, following the peak discharge at Jensen.

|      | HOBO               | Stage      | Date                  |
| ---- | :----------------: | :--------: | :-------------------: |
|1.    | Hobo SLE1 Lower:   | 1438.751   | {{3/28/2018 15:45}}   |
|2.    | Hobo_1:            | 1440.905   | {{3/28/2018 14:00}}   |
|3.    | Hobo_4_Upper:      | 1443.547   | {{3/28/2018 10:30}}   |
|4.    | Hobo_6_1:          | 1445.008   | {{3/28/2018 10:00}}   |
